            <h3>spring</h3>
            <p>spring, in climatology, season of the year between winter and summer during which temperatures gradually
                rise</p>
            <p class="txt-center">In many cultures spring has been celebrated with rites and festivals revolving around
                its importance in
                food production. In European languages, the concept of spring is associated with the sowing of crops.

            <h3>summer</h3>
            <p>warmest season of the year, between spring and autumn</p>
            <p class="txt-center">The concept of summer in European languages is associated with growth and maturity,
                especially that of
                cultivated plants, and indeed summer is the season of greatest plant growth in regions with sufficient
                summer rainfall.</p>

            <h3>autumn</h3>
            <p> season of the year between summer and winter during which temperatures gradually decrease</p>
            <p class="txt-center">The autumn temperature transition between summer heat and winter cold occurs only in
                middle and high latitudes. In the polar regions autumn is very short.</p>

            <p>coldest season of the year, between autumn and spring</p>
            <p class="txt-center">The name comes from an old Germanic word that means “time of water” and refers to the
                rain and snow of
                winter in middle and high latitudes.</p>
